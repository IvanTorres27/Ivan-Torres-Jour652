    <p class="headline"> Was Maryland's move to the Big Ten the right decision?</p>
    <p class="byline"> by Ivan Torres</p>

    <center><p class="intro"> The history of the University of Maryland sports dates back to 1921 when they became a founding member of the Southern Conference. They stayed there until 1953 when they left and became of the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC).</p></center>

    <p class="body"> In 2012, the University of Maryland Board of Regents voted by an overwhelmingly large margin to accept the official invitation to join the Big Ten Conference effective July 1, 2014, upsetting traditionalists in the process.
</p>

    <p class="body"> For nearly 60 years, the University of Maryland’s most anticipated and memorable athletic events have come against rivals schools such as Duke, North Carolina and Virginia.

The Board of Regents voted to abandon that past for what they referred to as a more secure financial future.</p>

<p class="body"> Maryland’s move to the Big Ten would bring the athletic department a significant amount of money. Maryland’s television revenues from the ACC to the Big Ten will increase from approximately $8-10 million per year.</p>

<p class="body"> In 2012, the Big Ten paid out roughly $23.7 million to each of its full vested member schools. That number rose to $38.5 million in 2017 and is expected to rise to an astounding $56 million payout in 2019.

In 2012, the ACC signed a new television deal with ESPN that will bring in roughly $15 million per school annually through 2027.</p>

<p class="body"> As of 2018, the Big Ten conference has a sizable revenue advantage over schools in the SEC ($43 million), the Big 12 ($36.5 million), the Pac-12 ($32 million) and the ACC ($28 million).</p>

<p class="body"> Maryland will only reap those benefits after its probationary period expires in 2021. Add that with the $31.4 million ACC exit fee and traditionalists have more arguments for their side.</p>

<p class="body"> Besides athletic funding, Maryland cites both an academic and performance element in the shift. They jumped on the opportunity to be in a conference of large state schools with impressive academic credentials and relished on the point that alignment with the league would lead to the improvement of the Maryland football team to the point where it can compete in the Big Ten.</p>

<p class="body"> Big Ten schools participate in an academic exchange known as the Committee on Institutional Cooperation in which they all share federal research dollars which is a hard bargain to argue against but when asked where and how that money would be used, they refused to comment, leaving students questioning if they even cared about academics.</p>

<p class="body"> The ACC conference consists of seven of the nation’s top 50 schools and boasts the best school average out of all the power five conferences. In terms of the school size, Northwestern (BIG Ten) and Wake Forest (ACC), both conferences smallest schools, have a student population of about 8,300 and they receive or received the same conference benefits as Maryland.</p>
