    <center><p class="intro"> The history of the University of Maryland sports dates back to 1921 when they became a founding member of the Southern Conference. They stayed there until 1953 when they became a founding member of the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC).</p></center>

    <p class="body1"> In 2012, the University of Maryland Board of Regents voted by an overwhelmingly large margin to accept the official invitation to join the Big Ten Conference effective July 1, 2014.

<p class="chapter">Opinion</p>

    <p class="body"> For nearly 60 years, the University of Maryland’s most anticipated and memorable athletic events have come against rivals schools such as Duke, North Carolina and Virginia. Maryland fans are now stuck trying to build rivalries with Midwestern and Northwestern schools, schools they have little to no history with.

    <p class="body"> According to Barry Svrluga and Alex Prewitt from the Washington Post, reaction from many Terrapins fans and students was decidedly negative as their school abandoned its longtime affiliation with like-minded and nearby institutions for a new but ill-defined relationship with schools that to many seemed far away and unfamiliar.

<br></br>

    <p class="body"> Big Ten Commissioner Jim Delany reiterated fan dismay stating, “I know that there’s some ambivalence. I know that there’s some anger.”

    <p class="body"> Taylor Kemp, A Senior men’s soccer defender at the time, was one of many who expressed his disappointment. “Moving to the big 10? I came to maryland to play in the ACC, there goes a lot of tradition and pride #ACCforlife.”

    <p class="body"> Kristi Toliver, a member of Maryland’s 2006 national championship women’s basketball team, stated: “The big 10? That’s like exchanging your Bentley for a Buick.”

    <p class="body">  Torrey Smith, former wide receiver for the Baltimore Ravens who played football at Maryland from 2008 to 2010, had this to say: “No more UVA, Duke, NC talk. That’s weird. I still love the campus and the programs we have there, but I feel like if I were a recruit again I would’ve never chose MD because the reasons above are why I went there. Not being able to relate to anything at the school you graduated from is crazy.”

    <p class="body">  On his SirusXM show, Duke basketball coach Mike Krzyzewsk, had some strong words about Maryland's departure and all other schools part of the conference realignment. "If you’re running a business for a long time, you would be interested primarily in what is your brand. ... And when you give that up, what price is that? What does that do? In Maryland’s case, that’s the only conference they’ve known. And they’re right in the middle of the ACC. And now their fans, they don’t have a place. They’re outsiders. They really are outsiders. What price? What price is paid for that? "They didn’t get public opinion from their alums, from the people there. All these things are secret. It’s not out there. Some of it gets leaked, but in Maryland’s case it was never leaked. I’m really worried about that type of thinking."

    <p class="body"> In an interview with USA Today, Ryan Largent, a Maryland senior at the time stated: "It shocked me. "It happened so suddenly. As a student, I felt powerless, and I want clarity. ... Students were never given a say in the matter."

    <p class="body"> A recent survey of 151 students, alumni and fans shows that Maryland fans are still not satisfied, with 75.5 percent of them opposing the move. When asked to explain why, rivalries with Duke, UNC and UVA topping the list.

<br></br>

<p class="body"> Despite the backlash, there was a few strong supporters. NBCSports Washington called the move a "no-brainer." "I’d be surprised if this doesn’t get really strong support, universally, from people who care about Maryland,” stated regent Frank Kelly.

  <p class="body"> Initially, Maryland fans were shocked and curious about what the furue holds. About 7 years into the move, fans are furious and are wishing Maryland never left.

    <p class="chapter">Performance</p>

    <p class="body"> Maryland cited a performance element in the shift. They relished on the point that alignment with the league would lead to the improvement of the Maryland football team to the point where it can compete in the Big Ten.

    <p class="body"> Pat Forde of Yahoo Sports listed his winners and losers from the many chapters of conference realignment during the past decade. Maryland and Nebraska, which joined the conference in 2014 , were among the losers. He wrote:


    <p class="body"> "You could argue that Rutgers has been the biggest dumpster fire of the Big Ten’s eastward expansion, and you’d be 100 percent right. But the Scarlet Knights were admitted to The Club by the Big Ten, whereas Maryland already had Club membership and chose to abandon its ACC niche for more money, less identity and roughly identical competitive struggles. The Terrapins’ football record their final five years in the ACC: 24-38. Their record the first five years in the Big Ten: 25-37. Basketball has fared slightly better in the Big Ten than the latter years in the ACC, but the lather produced by Tobacco Road rivalries cannot be replicated by playing Iowa and Minnesota."

      <br></br>

      <p class="body"> According to watchstadium.com, Of the 12 schools, Maryland has had the most head coaching changes. New coach Mike Locksley is the Terps’ fourth different head coach since Maryland joined the Big Ten in 2014. Since joining the Big Ten, the Terps have had twice as many coaches as bowl appearances (two) and are 17 games under .500 in league play.

      <p class="body"> Maryland didn't fare any better this year posting a 1-8 conference record, moving them to 24 games under .500 in league play.

      <p class="body"> Maryland isn't known for it's football, but it's basketball prowess. Referring back to Pat Forde, "Basketball has fared slightly better in the Big Ten than the latter years in the ACC, but the lather produced by Tobacco Road rivalries cannot be replicated by playing Iowa and Minnesota."

      <p class="body"> Surely there was and still are people out there that support Maryland's move but to use football performance as your rational is unethical.

<p class="chapter">Financials</p>

<p class="body"> The Board of Regents voted to abandon the ACC for what they referred to as a more secure financial future. “Membership in the Big Ten is in the strategic interest of the University of Maryland. Number one, by being members of the Big Ten Conference, we will be able to ensure the financial sustainability of Maryland athletics for decades to come,” said university President Wallace D. Loh.

  According to NBC Sports, Maryland’s move to the Big Ten would bring the athletic department a significant amount of money. Maryland’s television revenues from the ACC to the Big Ten will increase from approximately $8-10 million per year.</p>

<p class="body"> In 2012, the Big Ten paid out roughly $23.7 million to each of its full vested member schools. That number rose to $38.5 million in 2017 and is expected to rise to an astounding $56 million payout in 2019.

In 2012, the ACC signed a new television deal with ESPN that will bring in roughly $15 million per school annually through 2027.</p>

<p class="body"> As of 2018, the Big Ten conference has a sizable revenue advantage over schools in the SEC ($43 million), the Big 12 ($36.5 million), the Pac-12 ($32 million) and the ACC ($28 million).</p>

<p class="body"> Maryland will only reap it's full benefits after its probationary period expires in 2021. Add that with the $31.4 million ACC exit fee and traditionalists have more arguments for their side. Regardless, it's a hard bargain to argue against the financial gain of Maryland's move.</p>

<p class="chapter">Education</p>

<p class="body"> Besides athletic funding and performance, Maryland cites an academic and element in the shift. They jumped on the opportunity to be in a conference of large state schools with impressive academic credentials. </p>

<p class="body"> Big Ten schools participate in an academic exchange known as the Committee on Institutional Cooperation in which they all share federal research dollars which is a hard to argue against but when asked where and how that money would be used, the university refused to comment, leaving students questioning if they even cared about academics.</p>

<p class="body"> In terms of conference academics, according to the US News & World Report, the ACC boasts the best school average of any FBS conference, with an average rank of 54.7. According to thecomeback.com, the ACC is also the only FBS conference to put six member schools among the top 35 and seven schools among the top 40.

  <br></br>

<p class="body"> The Big Ten places second with an average rank of 57.2, and only two in the top 40. Notre Dame which is a partial ACC member, was omitted in the release which helps the Big Ten since Notre Dame's ranking is 18.

<p class="body"> In terms of average student body size, Big Ten schools have a larger student body than ACC schools.  </p>

<br></br>

<p class="body"> In Summary, Maryland's move to the Big Ten sparked much controversy and disappointment. It's hard to deny Maryland's monetary gain and moving to a conference with larger schools but you can't defend their performance or academic rationales. One thing is clear, throughout Maryland's time in the Big Ten, disappointment is growing within the fanbase. </p>
