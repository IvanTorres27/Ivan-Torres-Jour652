<p class="chapter">Opinion</p>

    <p class="body"> For nearly 60 years, the University of Maryland’s most anticipated and memorable athletic events have come against rivals schools such as Duke, North Carolina and Virginia. Maryland fans are now stuck trying to build rivalries with Midwestern and Northwestern schools, schools they have little to no history with.

    <p class="body">Senior men’s soccer defender Taylor Kemp was one of many who took to Twitter to express his remorse. “Moving to the big 10?” he wrote. “I came to maryland to play in the ACC, there goes a lot of tradition and pride #ACCforlife”


    <p class="body"> Maryland cited a performance element in the shift. They relished on the point that alignment with the league would lead to the improvement of the Maryland football team to the point where it can compete in the Big Ten.

    <p class="body"> Pat Forde of Yahoo Sports listed his winners and losers from the many chapters of conference realignment during the past decade. Maryland and Nebraska, which joined the conference in 2014 , were among the losers. He wrote:

    <p class="body"> "You could argue that Rutgers has been the biggest dumpster fire of the Big Ten’s eastward expansion, and you’d be 100 percent right. But the Scarlet Knights were admitted to The Club by the Big Ten, whereas Maryland already had Club membership and chose to abandon its ACC niche for more money, less identity and roughly identical competitive struggles. The Terrapins’ football record their final five years in the ACC: 24-38. Their record the first five years in the Big Ten: 25-37. Basketball has fared slightly better in the Big Ten than the latter years in the ACC, but the lather produced by Tobacco Road rivalries cannot be replicated by playing Iowa and Minnesota."

      <p class="body"> Of the 12 schools, Maryland has had the most head coaching changes. New coach Mike Locksley is the Terps’ fourth different head coach since Maryland joined the Big Ten in 2014. Since joining the Big Ten, the Terps have had twice as many coaches as bowl appearances (two) and are 17 games under .500 in league play.

      <p class="body"> Maryland didn't fare any better this year posting a 1-8 conference record, moving them to 24 games under .500 in league play.



  Initially, fan opinion was evenly divided with traditionalists making up the bulk of unsatisfied fans. but as time has progressed, fans are wishing they never left.

<p class="body"> The Board of Regents voted to abandon the ACC for what they referred to as a more secure financial future. Maryland’s move to the Big Ten would bring the athletic department a significant amount of money. Maryland’s television revenues from the ACC to the Big Ten will increase from approximately $8-10 million per year.</p>

<p class="body"> In 2012, the Big Ten paid out roughly $23.7 million to each of its full vested member schools. That number rose to $38.5 million in 2017 and is expected to rise to an astounding $56 million payout in 2019.

In 2012, the ACC signed a new television deal with ESPN that will bring in roughly $15 million per school annually through 2027.</p>

<p class="body"> As of 2018, the Big Ten conference has a sizable revenue advantage over schools in the SEC ($43 million), the Big 12 ($36.5 million), the Pac-12 ($32 million) and the ACC ($28 million).</p>

<p class="body"> Maryland will only reap those benefits after its probationary period expires in 2021. Add that with the $31.4 million ACC exit fee and traditionalists have more arguments for their side.</p>

<p class="body"> Besides athletic funding, Maryland cites both an academic and performance element in the shift. They jumped on the opportunity to be in a conference of large state schools with impressive academic credentials and emphasized on the point that alignment with the league would lead to the improvement of the Maryland football team to the point where it can compete in the Big Ten.</p>

<p class="body"> Big Ten schools participate in an academic exchange known as the Committee on Institutional Cooperation in which they all share federal research dollars which is a hard bargain to argue against but when asked where and how that money would be used, they refused to comment, leaving students questioning if they even cared about academics.</p>

<p class="body"> The ACC conference consists of seven of the nation’s top 50 schools and boasts the best school average out of all the power five conferences. In terms of the school size, Northwestern (BIG Ten) and Wake Forest (ACC), both conferences smallest schools, have a student population of about 8,300 and they receive or received the same conference benefits as Maryland.</p>
